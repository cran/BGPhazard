\title{
Times of Remission of Leukemia Patients (Gehan)
}
\description{
Freireich et al. (1963) report the results of a clinical trial of a drug 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) versus a placebo (control) in 42 children with acute leukemia. The trial was conducted at 11 American hospitals. The trial was conducted by matching pairs of patients at a given hospital by remission status (complete or partial) and randomizing within the pair to either a 6-MP or placebo maintenance therapy. Patients were followed until their leukemia returned (relapse) or until the end of the study (in weeks). The data was taken from Klein & Moeschberger (2003) and is contained in the \code{MASS} package.
